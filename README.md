# system_monitor
 The project includes implementations in Bash, Python, and C++ for cross-platform demonstration and learning purposes.  
 
 Bash script: Monitors system resources on Unix-like systems and prints colored alerts.
 Python script: (To be implemented) Monitors system resources using standard libraries, works on Windows and Linux.
 C++ program: (To be implemented) Monitors system resources using platform-specific APIs. Usage: Each script checks CPU, memory, and disk usage, and   prints an alert if any resource exceeds its threshold.

 System Resource Monitor with Email Alerts

This is a simple Bash-based system resource monitoring script that tracks CPU, memory, and disk usage on a Linux system (tested on Ubuntu/WSL). The script sends email alerts when any of these resources exceed predefined thresholds.

The project was a part of my exploration of Linux command-line tools, Bash scripting, and basic email notifications using mailutils.
