# system_monitor
System Resource Monitor  This project provides simple scripts to monitor system resources (CPU, memory, and disk usage) and send alerts when usage exceeds specified thresholds. The project includes implementations in Bash, Python, and C++ for cross-platform demonstration and learning purposes.  Bash script: Monitors system resources on Unix-like systems and prints colored alerts. Python script: (To be implemented) Monitors system resources using standard libraries, works on Windows and Linux. C++ program: (To be implemented) Monitors system resources using platform-specific APIs. Usage: Each script checks CPU, memory, and disk usage, and prints an alert if any resource exceeds its threshold.
